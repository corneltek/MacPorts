  <title>DarwinPorts Roadmap</title> 

  <sect1>
    <title>About this Chapter</title>

    <para>This is the DarwinPorts roadmap for future development.  This
      chapter will contain a verbose TODO list for the project, as well
      as (once these goals are acheived) a place where new features
      and/or changes will be documented prior to their incorporation
      into the Guide as a whole.</para>

    <title>Remove cruft from DarwinPorts API</title>

    <para>Most of the DarwinPorts API (<function>dportsearch</function>,
      etc) is intended for use by external applications, such as Ports
      Manager and <command>port</command>(1).  However, the DarwinPorts
      "API" has grown organically, and there is a lot of cruft and clean
      up that could be done. One piece of low hanging fruit would be to
      use Tcl namespaces to properly remove the DarwinPorts API from the
      global namespace, and only namespace export the dport*
      procedures.</para>
