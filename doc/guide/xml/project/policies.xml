  <title>MacPorts Policies</title> 

  <sect1>
    <title>About this Chapter</title>

		<para>This chapter contains policies and procedures, as well as
		responsbilities for the MacPorts Project.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1>
	  <title>Port Maintenance Protocol</title>
	  <para>
		  MacPorts does not enforce exclusive write access to the maintainer
		  of a given Port, however it is normal practice to inform the maintainer
		  before making any changes to a Port. Detailed procedures are described 
		  below.   
	  </para>
	  <sect2>
		  <title>Updating Ports You Do Not Maintain</title>
		  <para>
			  If you have identified a port for which you have a 
			  suggestion, because it is broken, insecure, out of date or 
			  could be enhanced in some way you should:
		  </para>
		  <orderedlist numeration='arabic'>
			  <listitem>
				  Write patch for the port that resolves the issue, 
				  and email maintainer or file a bug in Trac,
				  appropriately assigned to the maintainer of the port. If 
				  you can't write a patch, file a bug and ignore the 
				  following steps...
			  </listitem>
			  <listitem>
				  Wait for response from maintainer. You should receive 
				  a response within 72hrs. Once you are in a dialog with 
				  a maintainer, the maintainer should review and apply 
				  patches.
			  </listitem>
			  <listitem>
				  If a response is not received within 72hrs another 
				  committer should  review the patches and update the port 
				  (this may be the person originally submitting the patches). 
				  If the person suggesting the changes does not have 
				  write-access to the repository, they should send an 
				  email to macports-dev@lists.macosforge.org with a summary of the 
				  bug and a reference to a Trac bug.
			  </listitem>

		  </orderedlist>
		  <para>
			  There are several situations in which this procedure can be waived:
		  </para>

		  <orderedlist>
			  <listitem>
				  A mass update to macports which touches many ports 
				  (usually because of a change in the macports 
				  infrastructure)
			  </listitem>
			  <listitem>
				  The port is broken in a way that requires urgent action. 
				  This may be because the port breaks system functionality 
				  or the current version has a serious security problem.
			  </listitem>
			  <listitem>
				  The port maintainer is not defined or is assigned to 
				  nomaintainer@macports.org. Feel free to take over 
				  such ports!
			  </listitem>
			  <listitem>
				  The port is abandoned by it's current maintainer. 
				  i.e. Any Port with a 'Port Abandoned' bug (explained below)
				  can be updated without contacting the maintainer.
			  </listitem>
		  </orderedlist>
	  </sect2>
	  <sect2>
		  <title>Port Abandonment</title>
		  <para>
			  Abandonment is defined as when a bug has not been acknowledged 
			  for more than 3 weeks after the bug was filed. If this occurs 
			  a new bug should be filed in Trac against the port with 
			  the subject: [Port Abandoned] and that port should reference 
			  the ignored bug.
		  </para>
		  <para>
			  The Port Abandoned bug should be resolved when a new maintainer 
			  is assigned.
		  </para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Committer's Category Responsibility List</title>

		<para>MacPorts has at least one committer responsible for each
		category of ports (<filename>www</filename>,
		<filename>textproc</filename>, etc).  This is a list of those
		committers.</para>
