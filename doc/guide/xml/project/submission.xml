		<title>Submitting a Port</title> 
		
		<para>Using a standardised approach to submitting the Portfiles and 
		associated patches scripts, etc allows us to keep track of port 
		submissions, process them efficiently and get them submitted as 
		quickly as possible to our ports tree in Subversion. The following sections 
		will describe the standard port submission procedures. </para>
		
		<sect2>
			<title>Where to submit</title>
			
			<para> All ports should be submitted via the MacPorts 
			<ulink url="http://trac.macports.org/project/macports/newticket">Trac tool
			</ulink>. If you are uncertain about 
			any aspect of your port, you may also want to email it with your 
			questions and the ticket number to  
			<ulink url="mailto:macports-dev@lists.macosforge.org">MacPorts</ulink> 
			mailing list.</para>
			
			<para>If you are submitting a modification, or an update to an 
			existing port, please assign the port to the current maintainer 
			in your Trac submission, so that the automatic email is 
			directed to the maintainer, who will be best suited to deal 
			with your submission. Also, due to a current misconfiguration in Trac,
			add the current maintainer to the <guilabel>Cc</guilabel> field, to make
			sure they are notified.</para>
			
			<para>Updates and modifications should be submitted as diffs. See 
			updating a port below.</para>
			
		</sect2>

			<title>Using Trac to submit a Port</title>
			
			<para>The following section describes in some more detail how to 
			use Trac to submit your port.</para>

				<para>The following general points should also be borne in 
				mind when submitting to Trac:
					<simplelist type="vert">
						<member>Small changes may be attached or included
						in the description field.</member>
						<member>Larger changes should be attached as a 
						single file.</member>
						<member>Multiple patched files should be bundled 
						together using tar and attached to the submission.</member>
						<member>Currently attachments must be sent in 
						using the current bug number, remeber to query 
						Trac to find out the current bug number, select
						 that bug and use the 'Create a New Attachment' 
						 link.</member>

		<sect2>
			<title>Updating a port</title>
			<para>The following guidelines are for submitting updates to 
			ports that are currently in the tree</para>

			<para>All updates and modifications to existing ports should 
			be sent in as diffs.</para>
			<para>There are a couple of ways to obtain correct diff 
			formats</para>
			<para>Using diff:
				<simplelist type="vert">
					<member>Obtain the original file (oldfile)</member>
					
					<member>cp oldfile oldfile.new</member>
					
					<member>edit oldfile.new and save your changes</member>
					
					<member>diff -u oldfile oldfile.new > oldfile.diff</member>
					
					<member>use Trac to submit your port UPDATE, assigning the bug to the corresponding port maintainer.</member>
					
				</simplelist></para>

			<para>Or using svn diff:
				<simplelist type="vert">
					<member>checkout the original source using svn</member>
					<member>edit the files and save your changes</member>
					<member>svn diff sourcefile > sourcefile.diff</member>
					<member>use Trac to submit your port UPDATE, assigning the bug to the corresponding port maintainer.</member>
				</simplelist></para>

			<para>Lastly, if your update consists of several files, use tar 
			to bundle them into one file for submission</para>

		<title>Submission to other project areas</title>

		<para>If you instead plan to contribute to the project by making a submission
		to any other of its areas, like the &#34;base&#34; section holding the MacPorts
		sources themselves, the guidelines for such are very similar to those outlined
		above. Just be sure to choose the correct component (be that &#34;base&#34;, &#34;doc&#34;,
		&#34;www&#34; or any other) of the MacPorts product when creating the Trac entry.</para>
