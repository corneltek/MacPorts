    <title>DarwinPorts Manager.app</title>
    
    <para>DarwinPorts Manager.app is a Cocoa GUI for the DarwinPorts
      project.  It will allow users to browse through available ports and
      their descriptions and to download, install, and uninstall the
      software.  DarwinPorts Manager.app is currently under development,
      and is based on the older Ports Manager.app.  There is a Port for
      the older Ports Manager.app, and will be in the future for
      DarwinPorts Manager.app, so you can use DarwinPorts to install it
      for you!  <userinput>sudo port install PortsManager</userinput>.
      Ports Manager.app will be installed in your
      <filename>/Applications/Utilities</filename> folder.  A <ulink
      url='http://www.opendarwin.org/~fkr/portsmanager.png'>screen shot
      is available</ulink> of Ports Manager.app in action.</para>

    <para>We will also be providing a binary installer (a '.pkg') file in
      the near future for DarwinPorts Manager.app.</para>
