    <title>Using Trac for tickets</title>

    <para>The MacPorts Project uses a system called <ulink
    url="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</ulink> to file tickets to report bugs
    and enhancement requests. Trac also provides an interface to browse the
    <ulink url="https://trac.macports.org/browser/">MacPorts
    Subversion repository</ulink>. Though anyone may search Trac for tickets,
    you must <ulink
    url="https://trac.macports.org/auth/register/">register</ulink> for a Trac
    account to create tickets.</para>

          <para>
            In general, application bugs should be reported to the developers of the app
            ("upstream"), not MacPorts. An application bug that affects a large number of
            MacPorts users might merit a MacPorts bug for informational purposes only, but
            this should be done sparingly.

          url="https://trac.macports.org/wiki/WikiFormatting">Wiki
          formatting</ulink> should be used to ensure that text is formatted
          correctly. Use the Preview button before submitting. If you want to
          post preformatted text such as a log or terminal output, make sure
          you use <literal>{{{<replaceable>...</replaceable>}}}</literal>
          around the text or it could break the page layout. Example:</para>

          <para>Submitters are advised to trim inline pastes and logs to
          what's really relevant to the report, as otherwise overly large
          ticket pages can become unmanageable. Long output, such as the
          full log from a port build, should be added as an attachment, not
          pasted inline. See "I have files to attach to this ticket" below.

          affects OS X 10.4, "haspatch" if a fix is attached to the ticket,
          "maintainer" if you are the port's maintainer, or "LP64" if

    <title>Port Update Policies</title>

    <para>Port maintainers normally are given commit privileges to the
    Subversion repository so they can make updates to their own ports.
    However, The MacPorts Project does not restrict commit privileges for
    maintainers, so before a person other than a port's maintainer updates a
    port it is a good practice to inform a port's maintainer. See details
    below.</para>

    <section id="project.update-policies.nonmaintainer">
      <title>Non-Maintainer Port Updates</title>

      <para>If you have a port update or bugfix for a port you do not

      the following guidelines:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>If a port's maintainer is

        <listitem>
          <para>If a port's maintainer contains the address

          author allows minor updates to the port without contacting him
