This is the MacPorts documentation directory.

To generate it you have to checkout the whole "trunk/doc-new" directory,
and you need the "docbook-xsl", "docbook-xml-4.5" and "libxslt" ports.
If your port installation isn't in /opt/local, edit or override the
PREFIX Makefile variable.

To generate the guide and the man pages just run "make" in this
directory; they will be placed in guide/html and man/man.

To generate a PDF version of the guide, use "make guide-dblatex". This
requires the "dblatex" port.
