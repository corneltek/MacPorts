This is the MacPorts documentation directory.

To generate it you have to checkout the whole "trunk/doc-new" directory and
you need the "docbook-xsl", "docbook-xml" and "libxslt" ports. If your port
installation isn't in /opt/local, edit or override the PREFIX Makefile
variable.

To generate the guide and the man pages just use "make" in this directory.
Then they are generated in guide/html and man/man.

To generate a PDF version of the guide, use "make guide-dblatex". This
requires the "dblatex" port.
