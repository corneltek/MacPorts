This is the MacPorts documentation directory.

To generate it you have to checkout the whole "trunk/doc-new" directory and
you need the "docbook-xsl", "docbook-xml" and "libxslt" ports. If your port
installation isn't in /opt/local look at "Makefile" how you have to change
this setup.

To generate the guide and the man pages just use "make" in this directory.
Then they are generated in guide/html and man/man.
