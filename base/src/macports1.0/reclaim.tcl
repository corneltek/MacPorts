# TODO:

# Finished:
# Add ui_debug statments
# Catch some error-prone areas.
# Remove the useless/structure comments and add actual docstrings.
# Add copyright notice
# Check if inactive ports are dependents of other ports.
# Add test cases
# Add distfile version checking.
# Pretty sure we should be using ui_msg, instead of puts and what not. Should probably add that.
# Register the "port cleanup" command with port.tcl and all that involves.
# Implement a hash-map, or multidimensional array for ease of port info keeping. Write it yourself if you have to.
# Figure out what the hell is going on with "port clean all" vs "port clean installed" the 'clean' target is provided by this package

# XXX: all prompts for the user need to use the ui_ask_* API
#      (definitely required for GUI support)
