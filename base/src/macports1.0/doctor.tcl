# Todo:

# Done:
# Add -q for quiet mode, where we don't print anything
# Check for command line tools
# Check for any DYLD_* environmental variables
# Check for '.la' in dylib and '.prl'
# Check if installed files are readable 
# Check for sqlite
# Check for openssl
# Crowd-source more ideas from the mailing-list
# Check if $PATH is first
# Check for issues with compilation. Compile small, simple file, check for "couldn't create cache file"
# check_for_stray_developer_directory
# Check for *.h, *.hpp, *.hxx in /usr/local/include
# Check for *.dylib in /usr/local/lib
# Check for other package managers. Fink = /sw, homebrew = /usr/local/Cellar
# Check for all files installed by ports exists
# Check for archives from all ports exists
# Check for things in /usr/local
# Check for x11.app if the OS is 10.6 and suggest installing xorg-server or the site on macosforge
# Add error catching for line's without an equals sign. 
# Support comments for the parser
# Check for amount of drive space
# Move port_doctor.ini to the port tree, below _resources 
# Check for curl
# Check for rsync
# Check if macports is in /opt/local
