NAME
----
port-dependents - List ports that depend on a given (installed) port

SYNOPSIS
--------
[cmdsynopsis]
*port* [*-D* 'portdir'] *dependents*
     [['portname' | 'pseudo-portname' | 'port-expressions' | 'port-url']]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*port dependents* reports which ports depend upon a given (installed) port, if
any. Note that *dependents* does not work for ports that are not installed on
your system. It uses the database of installed ports that MacPorts keeps
internally, which records the dependency relations at installation time. *port
dependents* prints this information.

For this reason, *port dependents* does not work for ports that are not
installed on your system. If you want to find out which ports depend on a port
you haven't installed, you can use the *depends:* pseudo-portname selector:

----
port echo depends:<portname>
----

This command will, however, not cover dependencies that are only present in
non-default variants. For more information about pseudo-portname selectors, see
man:port[1].

The dependency relations printed by *port dependents* are the same that are used
to determine if a port can be safely uninstalled. Ports that still have
dependents installed cannot be uninstalled without either the
*--follow-dependents* or the *-f* flag. See man:port-uninstall[1] for more
details.
