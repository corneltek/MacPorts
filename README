WHAT IS THE DARWIN PORTS SYSTEM

    Darwin Ports is a software build, install, and packaging infrastructure
designed to meet the same functionality requirements as the FreeBSD ports
architecture while maintaining extensibility for future enhancement.

    Darwin Ports currently builds and runs on MacOS X 10.2 (Darwin 6.0). The
system is portable, written in TCL with a limited set of TCL extensions in C.

    For in-depth documentation on the internals of the ports system
architecture, refer to base/docs/INTERNALS.

    Please note that darwinports is split into two parts.  The "darwin ports
infrastructure", which lives in the base/ subdirectory and is the only
mandatory component of the system, and the "dports" directory which contains
the actual ported software descriptions.  The latter is optional and can be
either fetched on demand over the net or a local copy can be used.  See
documentation on /etc/ports/sources.conf below.

INSTALLATION

    Installation Steps:
        1. make
		Run 'make' to compile all necessary software.

	2. sudo make install
		Run 'sudo make install' to install darwinports on your system.

	3. [optional] edit /etc/ports/ports.conf
		The /etc/ports/ports.conf configuration file defines several
		configuration options for the DarwinPorts infrastructure. If
		you wish to change installation paths or the location at
		which various port system specific data is stored, change the
		following settings:

		portdbpath - Specifies path to store ports system specific data.

		prefix - Specifies directory in which to install ports

	3. edit /etc/ports/sources.conf
		The /etc/ports/sources.conf file lists the location of
		both local and remote port software hierarchies. Be sure
		to add an entry for your local ports tree
		(usually the darwinports/dports directory)

    All necessary code and TCL will be compiled and installed as follows:
	[Mac OS X] /System/Library/Tcl/8.3/darwinports1.0
	[FreeBSD] /usr/local/lib/tcl8.3/darwinports1.0
	    - TCL library for interfacing with the Darwin Ports System

	PREFIX is set to /opt/local but can be overridden on the make command
	line and affects the installation of the following components:

	$PREFIX/bin/port
	    - Command line port building utility
	$PREFIX/share/darwinports/
	    - TCL libraries internal to the ports system

	The following files are provided for customization of the system:

	/etc/defaults/ports.conf
	    - System-wide port default settings
	/etc/ports/ports.conf
	    - User customizable port settings
	/etc/ports/sources.conf
	    - List of port sources (places to get ports data from)


USING THE PORT COMMAND

    If you haven't already, add /opt/local/bin to your path (or $PREFIX/bin
if you've elected to install darwinports somewhere else). If you're
unsure how, add the following line to your ~/.cshrc file.

	set path=($path /opt/local/bin)

    Your changes to ~/.cshrc will not take effect until you have opened
a new shell.

    The following command will build and install a port:

	port install <portname>

    To find a specific port, try using "port search".

	port search vi

    Please refer to the port man page for complete documentation on the port
    command.

    It is also possible to do operations, like building or fetching, for
    all ports on the system using the portall command.  It takes essentially
    the same arguments as the port command but operates iteratively on every
    port in dports/.  When you do a "make clean" from this directory, for
    example, a "portall clean" is also invoked to completely clean things up.


CREATING NEW PORTS

    Ports consist of directory containing both a Portfile and associated
files. Currently the only bundled files are patch files, and these are likely
to be kept to a minimum.

    A Portfile consists of valid TCL, evaluated by a TCL interpreter
instantiated by the Darwin Ports System. Portfiles use extremely straight-
forward key/value pair syntax, while allowing the author to use the full
extent of TCL's functionality where necessary.

    To get started, refer to doc/exampleport and the portfile(7) man page.
