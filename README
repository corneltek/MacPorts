WHAT IS THE DARWIN PORTS SYSTEM

    Darwin Ports is a software build, install, and packaging infrastructure
designed to meet the same functionality requirements as the FreeBSD ports
architecture while maintaining extensibility for future enhancement.

    Darwin Ports currently builds and runs on MacOS X 10.2 (Darwin 6.0). The
system is portable, written in TCL with a limited set of TCL extensions in C.

INSTALLING

    Summary:
        1. make
	2. sudo make install
	3. edit /etc/ports.conf

    All necessary code and TCL will be compiled and installed as follows:
	/System/Library/Tcl/8.3/darwinports1.0
	    - TCL library for interfacing with the Darwin Ports System
	/opt/local/bin/portbuild
	    - Command line port building utility
	/opt/local/share/darwinports/
	    - TCL libraries internal to the ports system
	/etc/ports.conf
	    - System-wide port settings

    The /etc/ports.conf configuration file takes the same directives as
a Portfile, and can be used to override all ports' defaults. There are optional
and required directives that you should configure at install time.

	sysportpath	- (required) Specifies the path to the ports system.
			    Used to find and build port dependencies
	ports_debug	- (optional) Takes either a "yes" or "no" value.
			    If set, debug messages are printed
	ports_verbose	- (optional) Takes either a "yes" or "no" value.
			    If set, informational messages are printed

USING PORTBUILD

    All included port descriptions are currently stored in the software/
subdirectory of the ports distribution, in the form of:

	software/<category>/<portname>

    To build a port, cd to the port's directory and run 'portbuild'. To install
a port, run 'portbuild install'. Please refer to the portbuild man page for
complete documentation on the 'portbuild' command.

CREATING NEW PORTS

    Ports consist of directory containing both a Portfile and associated
files. Currently the only bundled files are patch files, and these are likely
to be kept to a minimum.

    A Portfile consists of valid TCL, evaluated by a TCL interpreter
instantiated by the Darwin Ports System. Portfiles use extremely straight-
forward key/value pair syntax, while allowing the author to use the full
extent of TCL's functionality where necessary.

    To get started, refer to doc/exampleport.
