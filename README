WHAT IS THE DARWIN PORTS SYSTEM

    Darwin Ports is a software build, install, and packaging infrastructure
designed to meet the same functionality requirements as the FreeBSD ports
architecture while maintaining extensibility for future enhancement.

    Darwin Ports currently builds and runs on MacOS X 10.2 (Darwin 6.0). The
system is portable, written in TCL with a limited set of TCL extensions in C.

    For in-depth documentation on the internals of the ports system
architecture, refer to docs/INTERNALS.

INSTALLING

    Installation Steps:
        1. make
		Run 'make' within the darwinports directory to compile
		all necessary software.

	2. sudo make install
		Run 'sudo make install' within the darwinports directory
		to install darwinports on your system.

	3. edit /etc/ports/ports.conf
		The /etc/ports/ports.conf configuration file takes the same
		directives as a Portfile, and can be used to override all
		ports' defaults. There are required and optional directives
		that you should configure at install time.

		portdbpath - (options) Specifies path to store ports system
			    specific data.

		ports_debug - (optional) Takes either a "yes" or "no" value.
			    If set, debug messages are printed

		ports_verbose - (optional) Takes either a "yes" or "no" value.
			    If set, informational messages are printed

	3. edit /etc/ports/sources.conf
		The /etc/ports/sources.conf file lists the location of
		both local and remote port software hierarchies. By default,
		the ports system will fetch ports from www.opendarwin.org.
		If you wish to use a local ports tree, specify it here.

    All necessary code and TCL will be compiled and installed as follows:
	/System/Library/Tcl/8.3/darwinports1.0
	    - TCL library for interfacing with the Darwin Ports System
	/opt/local/bin/port
	    - Command line port building utility
	/opt/local/share/darwinports/
	    - TCL libraries internal to the ports system
	/etc/defaults/ports.conf
	    - System-wide port default settings
	/etc/ports/ports.conf
	    - User customizable port settings
	/etc/ports/sources.conf
	    - List of port sources


USING THE PORT COMMAND

    If you haven't already, add /opt/local/bin to your path. If you're
unsure how, add the following line to your ~/.cshrc file.

	set path=($path /opt/local/bin)

    Your changes to ~/.cshrc will not take effect until you have opened
a new shell.

    To update your local indexes, run:

        port sync

    The following command will build and install a port:

	port install <portname>

    To find a specific port, try using "port search".

	port search vi

    Please refer to the port man page for complete documentation on the port
    command.

CREATING NEW PORTS

    Ports consist of directory containing both a Portfile and associated
files. Currently the only bundled files are patch files, and these are likely
to be kept to a minimum.

    A Portfile consists of valid TCL, evaluated by a TCL interpreter
instantiated by the Darwin Ports System. Portfiles use extremely straight-
forward key/value pair syntax, while allowing the author to use the full
extent of TCL's functionality where necessary.

    To get started, refer to doc/exampleport and the portfile(7) man page.
