description	monitor the progress of data through a pipe
long_description 	pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool \
			for monitoring the progress of data through a \
			pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal \
			pipeline between two processes to give a visual \
			indication of how quickly data is passing through, \
			how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, \
			and an estimate of how long it will be until completion.
