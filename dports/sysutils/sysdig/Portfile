description         ${name} is an open source system-level exploration and troubleshooting tool.
long_description    Sysdig captures system calls and other system level events \
                    using a linux kernel facility called tracepoints, which \
                    means much less overhead than strace. It then "packetizes" \
                    this information, so that you can save it into trace files \
                    and filter it, a bit like you would do with tcpdump. This \
                    makes it very flexible to explore what processes are doing. \
                    Sysdig is also packed with a set of scripts that make it \
                    easier to extract useful information and do troubleshooting.
