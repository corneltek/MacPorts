description     Intelligent Platform Management Interface management utility
long_description \
  IPMItool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that \
  support the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) version \
  1.5 and version 2.0 specifications. IPMI is an open standard for \
  monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and control of hardware that \
  is implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS. The ipmitool \
  program provides a simple command-line interface to the Baseboard \
  Management Controller. It features the ability to read the sensor data \
  repository (SDR) and print sensor values, display the contents of the \
  System Event Log (SEL), print Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory \
  information, read and set LAN configuration parameters, and perform \
  remote chassis power control.
