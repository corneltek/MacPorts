    Online encrypted backup service (client)

long_description \
    Tarsnap is an online encrypted backup service.  It presents a tar-like\
    command-line interface, but stores data online rather than locally\;\
    using ideas taken from the author's FreeBSD Update and Portsnap\
    utilities, it maximizes performance by recognizing duplicate data and\
    only storing it once, and cryptographically encrypts and signs archives\
    using locally-held keys in order to guarantee that nobody without access\
    to the key file (including the author) can read or modify archives.

notes "
If you have never used tarsnap before, you will need to create an account\
with the tarsnap service and deposit money into the account before you\
can start using tarsnap; see

\thttps://www.tarsnap.com/gettingstarted.html

for details.

Once you have a tarsnap account you will need to create a key file using\
the tarsnap-keygen utility before you start storing archives; this key\
file MUST BE KEPT IN A SAFE LOCATION since you will not be able to read\
your backups without it.
