description         Forensic toolkit
long_description    The Sleuth Kit (previously known as TASK) is a collection \
    of UNIX-based command line file system and media management forensic \
    analysis tools. The file system tools allow you to examine file systems of \
    a suspect computer in a non-intrusive fashion. Because the tools do not \
    rely on the operating system to process the file systems, deleted and \
    hidden content is shown. \
    The media management tools allow you to examine the layout of disks and \
    other media. The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk \
    labels), Mac partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT \
    disks. With these tools, you can identify where partitions are located and \
    extract them so that they can be analyzed with file system analysis tools.
