description	Screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation
long_description	Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical \
			terminal between several processes (typically interactive shells). \
			Each virtual terminal provides the functions of a DEC VT100 terminal \
			and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO \
			6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g. insert/delete line and support for \
			multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each \
			virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows moving text \
			regions between windows.
