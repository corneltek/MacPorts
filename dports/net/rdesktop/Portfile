long_description	\
	rdesktop is an RDP clietn to access Microsoft Terminal Server \
	based services. \
	\
	The variant called w2k-license-hack is a backported patch from \
	an rdesktop 1.1 patchset which wasn't integrated into the latest \
	version -- it will announce the client as Windows 2000 machine \
	causing the Terminal Server to provide a license for free. \
	Please argue over this with your own conscience.
