description	Library to Access SMI MIB Information
long_description	The core of the libsmi distribution is a library \
			that allows management applications to access SMI MIB module \
 			definitions. On top of this library, there are tools to check, \
			analyze dump, convert, and compare MIB definitions. Finally, the \
			distribution contains a steadily maintained and revised archive of \
			all IETF and IANA maintained standard MIB and PIB modules. \
			The library is internally divided into two layers. The upper layers \
			represent the API to applications that make use of libsmi. \
			Furthermore, the upper layer holds the MIB information in common \
			internal data structures. The lower layer contains the drivers that \
			implement the access to persistent MIB module repositories. \
			Currently drivers for SMIv1/v2 MIB module files and for SPPI PIB \
			module files exist. A driver for an early draft of SMIng is also \
			present.
