long_description	\
	mdnsd is a very lightweight, simple, portable, and easy to integrate \
	open source implementation of Multicast DNS (part of Zeroconf, also \
	called Rendezvous by Apple) for developers. It supports both acting \
	as a Query and a Responder, allowing any software to participate \
	fully on the .local network just by including a few files and \
	calling a few functions.
