description	Port scanning utility for large networks
long_description	Nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works \
			fine for single hosts. The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap \
			was TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It). This is the Perl \
			slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners. Sometimes you need \
			speed, other times you may need stealth. In some cases, bypassing \
			firewalls may be required. Not to mention the fact that you may want \
			to scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.). You just can't do \
			all this with one scanning mode. And you don't want to have 10 \
			different scanners around, all with different interfaces and \
			capabilities.
