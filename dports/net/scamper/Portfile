description         Conduct Internet measurements
long_description    scamper is a program that is able to conduct Internet \
                    measurement tasks to large numbers of IPv4 and IPv6 \
                    addresses, in parallel, to fill a specified \
                    packets-per-second rate. Currently, it supports the \
                    well-known ping and traceroute techniques, as well as \
                    radargun, ally, mercator, sting, and parts of tbit.
