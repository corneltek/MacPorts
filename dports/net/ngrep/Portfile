long_description	ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying \
			them to the network layer. \
			ngrep a pcap-aware tool that will allow you to specify extended \
			regular expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It \
			currently recognizes TCP, UDP, and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, \
			FDDI, Token Ring and null interfaces, and understands BPF filter \
			logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, \
			like tcpdump and snoop.
