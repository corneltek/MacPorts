description	Layer four traceroute capable of tracing protocol paths
long_description	LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a \
			sort of 'traceroute' that often works much \
			faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson \
			method) and goes through many configurations \
			of packet-filter based firewalls. More \
			importantly, LFT implements numerous other \
			features including AS number lookups, \
			loose source routing, netblock name lookups,\
			et al.
