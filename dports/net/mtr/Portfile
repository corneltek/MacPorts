long_description	\
	As mtr starts,  it  investigates  the  network  connection \
	between  the  host  mtr  runs on and HOSTNAME.  by sending \
	packets with purposly low TTLs. It continues to send pack- \
	ets  with  low TTL, noting the response time of the inter- \
	vening routers.  This allows mtr  to  print  the  response \
	percentage  and  response  times  of the internet route to \
	HOSTNAME.  A sudden increase  in  packetloss  or  response \
	time  is  often  an  indication  of a bad (or simply over- \
	loaded) link.
