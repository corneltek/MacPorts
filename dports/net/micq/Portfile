description     portable text-mode ICQ clone	
long_description	mICQ is a very portable text-mode ICQ clone. \
                    Originally written by Matthew D. Smith, a great \
                    part of mICQ has been rewritten by Ruediger Kuhlmann, \
                    in particular the support for the new version 8 of the \
                    ICQ protocol that became necessary, the internationalization, \
                    the file transfer and some restructuring of the code.
