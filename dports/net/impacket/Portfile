description         Impacket is a collection of Python classes focused on \
                    providing access to network packets.
long_description    ${description} Impacket allows Python developers to craft \
                    and decode network packets in simple and consistent manner. \
                    It includes support for low-level protocols such as IP, UDP \
                    and TCP, as well as higher-level protocols such as NMB and \
                    SMB. Impacket is highly effective when used in conjunction \
                    with a packet capture utility or package such as Pcapy. \
                    Packets can be constructed from scratch, as well as parsed \
                    from raw data. Furthermore, the object oriented API makes \
                    it simple to work with deep protocol hierarchies.
