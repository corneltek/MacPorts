description         Protects hosts from brute force attacks against ssh and other services using ipfw

long_description    Sshguard monitors services from their logging activity. It \
                    reacts to messages about dangerous activity by blocking the \
                    source address with the local firewall. \
                    \
                    Sshguard employs a clever parser that can recognize several \
                    logging formats at once transparently (syslog, syslog-ng, \
                    metalog, multilog, raw messages), and detects attacks for \
                    many services out of the box, including SSH, FreeBSD's ftpd \
                    and dovecot.  It can operate all the major firewalling \
                    systems, including PF, netfilter/iptables, IPFIREWALL/ipfw, \
                    IPFILTER. \
                    \
                    Sshguard has several relevant features like support for \
                    IPv6, whitelisting, suspension, log message authentication. \
                    It is reliable, easy to set up and demands very few \
                    resources to the system.
