long_description	Pure-FTPd is a fast, production-quality, standard-conformant FTP server, \
			based upon Troll-FTPd. \

			configuration, has no known buffer overflow, it is really trivial to set \
			up and it is especially designed for modern kernels. \
			Features include chroot()ed and/or virtual chroot()ed home directories, \
			virtual domains, built-in 'ls', anti-warez system, bounded ports for \
			passive downloads, FXP protocol, bandwidth throttling, ratios, \
			LDAP / MySQL / PostgreSQL-based authentication, fortune files, Apache-like \
			log files, fast standalone mode, text / HTML / XML real-time status report, \
			virtual users, virtual quotas and more.
