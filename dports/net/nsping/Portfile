long_description	Nsping uses DNS queries to monitor reachability \
			and operation of nameservers, as well as the latency \
			of DNS queries. It does this by sending random recursive \
			DNS queries to the nameserver (avoiding the effects of \
			DNS caching) and measuring the amount of time between \
			the sending of the query and the receipt of the response packet.
