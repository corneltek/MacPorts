description	AIM message service client with a gtk-based interface
long_description	GAIM is an Open Source 'clone' of America OnLine's Instant Messenger \
			client using the GTK+ toolkit. It features most of the functionality \
			of the official AIM client while being much smaller and faster.  It \
			features multiple groups, group chat, user information fetching and \
			registration, time stamping, sound (for when you really do want to be \
			interrupted), multiple away messages, and more. \
			GAIM also has support for other IM protocols such as Yahoo!, MSN, ICQ, \
			Jabber, Napster, IRC, and Zephyr via included plugins.
