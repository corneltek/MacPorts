long_description	\
	tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP \
	connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient \
	for protocol analysis or debugging. A program like tcpdump(4) shows \
	a summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the \
	data that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow \
	reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow in a \
	separate file for later analysis.  tcpflow understands TCP sequence \
	numbers and will correctly reconstruct data streams regardless of \
	retransmissions or out-of-order delivery.
