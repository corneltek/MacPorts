description         Sophisticated file transfer program
long_description    LFTP is a shell-like command line ftp client. \
                    It is reliable: can retry operations and does reget automatically. \
                    It can do several transfers simultaneously in background. \
                    You can start a transfer in background and continue browsing \
                    the ftp site or another one. This all is done in one process. \
                    Background jobs will be completed in nohup mode if you exit \
                    or close modem connection. Lftp has reput, mirror, reverse \
                    mirror among its features.
