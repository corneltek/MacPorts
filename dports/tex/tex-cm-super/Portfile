description     CM-Super font package.
long_description \
                The CM-Super package contains Type 1 fonts converted from METAFONT \
                fonts and covers entire EC/TC, EC Concrete, EC Bright and LH fonts \
                (Computer Modern font families). All European and Cyrillic writings \
                are covered. Each Type 1 font program contains ALL glyphs from the \
                following standard LaTeX font encodings: T1, TS1, T2A, T2B, T2C, X2, \
                and also Adobe StandardEncoding (585 glyphs per non-SC font and 468 \
                glyphs per SC font), and could be reencoded to any of these encodings \
                using standard dvips or pdftex facilities (the corresponding support \
                files are also included).
