description         minimal try/catch with proper localization of $@
long_description    \
       The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error \
       handling for those having a hard time installing TryCatch, but who \
       still want to write correct \"eval\" blocks without 5 lines of \
       boilerplate each time.  It\'s designed to work as correctly as \
       possible in light of the various pathological edge cases and to be \
       compatible with any style of error values (simple strings, \
       references, objects, overloaded objects, etc).
