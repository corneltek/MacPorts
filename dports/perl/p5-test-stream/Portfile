description         Test::Stream - Experimental successor to Test::More and Test::Builder.
long_description    ${description} \
                    This is an experimental release! Test-Stream, and all its components \
                    are still in an experimental phase. This dist has been released to CPAN \
                    in order to allow testers and early adopters the chance to write experimental \
                    new tools with it, or to add experimental support for it into old tools. \
                    This is NOT a drop-in replacement for Test::More!
