long_description \
	This is Graph, a Perl module for dealing with graphs, the abstract \
	data structures.  (If you were looking for pie charts, I'm sorry.) \
	\
	This is a full rewrite of the Graph module 0.2xx series as discussed \
	in the book \"Mastering Algorithms with Perl\", written by Jarkko \
	Hietaniemi (the undersigned), John Macdonald, and Jon Orwant, \
	and published by O'Reilly and Associates.
