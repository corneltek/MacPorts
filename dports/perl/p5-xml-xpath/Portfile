description         set of modules for parsing and evaluating XPath statements
long_description    This module aims to comply exactly to the XPath \
                    specification at http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath and yet allow \
                    extensions to be added in the form of functions. Modules such \
                    as XSLT and XPointer may need to do this as they support \
                    functionality beyond XPath.
