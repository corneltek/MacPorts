description         Modules to assemble/disassemble network packets at the protocol level
long_description    NetPacket provides a base class for a cluster of modules \
                    related to decoding and encoding of network protocols. Each \
                    NetPacket descendent module knows how to encode and decode \
                    packets for the network protocol it implements.
