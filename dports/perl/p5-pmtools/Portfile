description         A suite of small programs to help manage Perl modules
long_description    \
    This is pmtools -- a suite of small programs to help manage modules. \
    The names are totally preliminary, and in fact, so is the code.  We \
    follow the \"keep it small\" notion of many tiny tools each doing one \
    thing well, eschewing giant megatools with millions of options.
