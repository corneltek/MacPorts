description         CGI::Fast - CGI Interface for Fast CGI

long_description    CGI::Fast is a subclass of the CGI object created by CGI.pm. It is \
                    specialized to work with the FCGI module, which greatly speeds up CGI \
                    scripts by turning them into persistently running server processes. \
                    Scripts that perform time-consuming initialization processes, such as \
                    loading large modules or opening persistent database connections, will \
                    see large performance improvements.
