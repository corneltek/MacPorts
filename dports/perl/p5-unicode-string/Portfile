description         String of Unicode characters (UCS2/UTF16)
long_description    A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of \
                    Unicode characters. The Unicode Standard is a \
                    fixed-width, uniform encoding scheme for written \
                    characters and text. This encoding treats alphabetic \
                    characters, ideographic characters, and symbols \
                    identically, which means that they can be used in any \
                    mixture and with equal facility. Unicode is modeled on \
                    the ASCII character set, but uses a 16-bit encoding to \
                    support full multilingual text.
