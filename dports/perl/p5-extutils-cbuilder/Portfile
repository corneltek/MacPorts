description           Compile and link C code for Perl modules
long_description      This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by \
                      invoking the appropriate compilers and linkers in a \
                      cross-platform manner.  It was motivated by the \
                      Module::Build project, but may be useful for other \
                      purposes as well.  However, it is not intended as a \
                      general cross-platform interface to all your C building \
                      needs.  That would have been a much more ambitious goal!
