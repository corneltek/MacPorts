description			Read/Write .ini style files with as little code as possible
long_description \
	"Config::Tiny" is a perl class to read and write .ini style \
	configuration files with as little code as possible, reducing load \
	time and memory overhead.  Most of the time it is accepted that Perl \
	applications use a lot of memory and modules.  The "::Tiny" family of \
	modules is specifically intended to provide an ultralight alternative \
	to the standard modules.\
	This module is primarily for reading human written files, and anything \
	we write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments.  If you need \
	something with more power move up to Config::Simple, Config::General \
	or one of the many other "Config::" modules. To rephrase, Config::Tiny \
	does not preserve your comments, whitespace, or the order of your \
	config file.
