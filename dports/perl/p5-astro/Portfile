description		   Assorted astronomical routines for perl
long_description   \
    Astro::Time, Astro::Coord and Astro::Misc provide a collection of useful \
    astronomical routines written entirely in Perl.  The routines provided include \
    various time conversions, coordinate transformations, and string parsing as \
    well as a number of astronomical tools. \
    \
    These routines should be used at your own risk! Most should give \
    reasonable accurate results, but spot checks against your favorite \
    program are recommenced. The B1950/J2000/Galactic coordinate routines \
    are based on SLALIB routines and agree very closely.
