description      basic perl functions providing descriptive statistics 
long_description   \
   Statistics::Descriptive provides basic functions used in descriptive \
   statistics. It has an object oriented design and supports two different \
   types of data storage and calculation objects: sparse and full. With the \
   sparse method, none of the data is stored and only a few statistical \
   measures are available. Using the full method, the entire data set is \
   retained and additional functions are available. \
   \
   Whenever a division by zero may occur, the denominator is checked to be \
   greater than the value \$Statistics::Descriptive::Tolerance, which defaults \
   to 0.0. You may want to change this value to some small positive value such \
   as 1e-24 in order to obtain error messages in case of very small \
   denominators. \
   \
   Many of the methods (both Sparse and Full) cache values so that subsequent \
   calls with the same arguments are faster. \
