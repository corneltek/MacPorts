description			Glues object frameworks together transparently
long_description \
	This class facilitates building frameworks of several classes that \
	inter-operate. It was first designed and built for HTML::Mason, in \
	which the Compiler, Lexer, Interpreter, Resolver, Component, Buffer, \
	and several other objects must create each other transparently, passing \
	the appropriate parameters to the right class, possibly substituting \
	other subclasses for any of these objects.
