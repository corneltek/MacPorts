description         network frame crafting made easy

long_description    This module is part of Net::Frame frame crafting \
                    framework. It is totally optional, but can make \
                    playing with the network far easier. \
                    Basically, it hides the complexity of frame forging, \
                    sending, and receiving, by providing helper methods, \
                    which will analyze internally how to assemble frames \
                    and find responses to probes. \
                    For example, it will take care of computing lengths \
                    and checksums, and matching a response frame to the \
                    requesting frame.
