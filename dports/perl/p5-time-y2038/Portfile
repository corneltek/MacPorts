description         Versions of Perl's time functions which work beyond 2038
long_description    On many computers, Perl's time functions will not \
                    work past the year 2038. This is a design fault \
                    in the underlying C libraries Perl uses. \
                    Time::y2038 provides replacements for those \
                    functions which will work accurately \
                    +/1 142 million years.
