# This variant avoids a conflict with the dict port, if one wishes to
# install p5-net-dict together with the dict port. The end user can
# later add symbolic links in /usr/local or in his home directory to
# choose which dict program (and man page) he wishes to use. For this
# reason, the dict documentation is not modified to reflect this new
# program name.
# Even though there is no filename conflict for the man page, it is
# better to rename it too for consistency when running "man dict".
# Even "man 1 dict" would select the dict.1pm version.
