    # This variant avoids a conflict with the dict port, if one wishes to
    # install p5-net-dict together with the dict port. The end user can
    # later add symbolic links in /usr/local or in his home directory to
    # choose which dict program (and man page) he wishes to use. For this
    # reason, the dict documentation is not modified to reflect this new
    # program name.
    # Even though there is no filename conflict for the man page, it is
    # better to rename it too for consistency when running "man dict".
    # Even "man 1 dict" would select the dict.1pm version.
