description         Allows conversion between Roman and Arabic algarisms

long_description \
  This package supports both conventional Roman algarisms (which range   \
  from 1 to 3999) and Milhar Romans, a variation which uses a bar across \
  the algarism to indicate multiplication by 1,000.  For the purposes of \
  this module, acceptable syntax consists of an underscore suffixed to   \
  the algarism e.g. IV_V = 4,005.  The term Milhar apparently derives    \
  from the Portuguese word for "thousands" and the range of this         \
  notation extends the range of Roman numbers to 3999 x 1000 + 3999 =    \
  4,002,999.
