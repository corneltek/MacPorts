description         Moo - Minimalist Object Orientation (with Moose compatibility)

long_description    This module is an extremely light-weight subset of Moose \
                    optimised for rapid startup and \"pay only for what you \
                    use\". \
                    \
                    It also avoids depending on any XS modules to allow simple \
                    deployments. The name Moo is based on the idea that it \
                    provides almost -- but not quite -- two thirds of Moose. \
                    \
                    Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full \
                    compatibility with Moose's surface syntax, preferring \
                    instead of provide full interoperability via the metaclass \
                    inflation capabilities described in \"MOO AND MOOSE\".
