description        Perl extension for access to network card configuration information

long_description   IO::Interface adds methods to IO::Socket objects that \
                   allows them to be used to retrieve and change information \
                   about the network interfaces on your system. In addition to \
                   the object-oriented access methods, you can use a \
                   function-oriented style. \
                   \
                   IO::Interface::Simple allows you to interrogate and change \
                   network interfaces. It has overlapping functionality with \
                   Net::Interface, but might compile and run on more platforms.
