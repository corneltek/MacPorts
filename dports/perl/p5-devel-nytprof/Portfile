description         Powerful feature-rich perl source code profiler
long_description    Devel::NYTProf is a powerful feature-rich perl source code profiler. \
	\
	o Performs per-line statement profiling for fine detail \
	o Performs per-subroutine statement profiling for overview \
	o Performs per-block statement profiling (the first profiler to do so) \
	o Accounts correctly for time spent after calls return \
	o Performs inclusive and exclusive timing of subroutines \
	o Subroutine times are per calling location (a powerful feature) \
	o Can profile compile-time activity, just run-time, or just END time \
	o Uses novel techniques for efficient profiling \
	o Sub-microsecond (100ns) resolution on systems with clock_gettime() \
	o Very fast - the fastest statement and subroutine profilers for perl \
	o Handles applications that fork, with no performance cost \
	o Immune from noise caused by profiling overheads and I/O \
	o Program being profiled can stop/start the profiler \
	o Generates richly annotated and cross-linked html reports \
	o Trivial to use with mod_perl - add one line to httpd.conf \
	o Includes an extensive test suite \
	o Tested on very large codebases \
	\
	NYTProf is effectively two profilers in one: a statement profiler, and a subroutine profiler.
