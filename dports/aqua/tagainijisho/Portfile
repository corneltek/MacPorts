description         A free Japanese dictionary and study assistant

long_description    Tagaini Jisho is a free, open-source Japanese \
                    dictionary and kanji lookup tool that is available \
                    for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux and aims at \
                    becoming your Japanese study assistant. It allows \
                    you to quickly search for entries and mark those \
                    that you wish to study, along with tags and \
                    personal notes. \
                    It also let you train entries you are studying \
                    and follows your progression in remembering them. \
                    Finally, it makes it easy to review entries you \
                    did not remember by listing them on screen \
                    or printing them on a small booklet.
