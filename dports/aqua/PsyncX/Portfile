description         Mac OS X wrapper around psync and crontab

long_description    ${name} is a ${description}. That means that PsyncX \
                    uses an existing free Unix application, psync, and the \
                    ability to schedule jobs (known as cron in Unix) to \
                    allow you to schedule backups whenever you want.
