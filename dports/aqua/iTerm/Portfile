long_description	\
	iTerm is a full featured terminal emulation program written 	\
	for OS X using Cocoa. We are aiming at providing users with 	\
	best command line experience under OS X. The letter i 		\
	represents a native Apple look and feel of the program 		\
	interface, and an emphasis on complete international support.
