description         OTR localhost AIM proxy
long_description    This is a localhost proxy you can use with almost any \
                    AIM client in order to participate in Off-the-Record \
                    conversations. The current version is 0.1.1, which \
                    means it's nothing like ready for prime time. In \
                    particular, it's got no UI at all (well, it outputs \
                    things to stdout).
