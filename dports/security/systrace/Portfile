version	       	2003-01-26 
categories      security sysutils	
description     commandline tool to watch systemcalls and block them
long_description	Systrace enforces system call policies for applications \
			by constraining the application's access to the system. \
			The policy is generated interactively. Operations not \
			covered by the policy raise an alarm, allowing an user \
			to refine the currently configured policy. \
			Systrace needs a xnu-kernel which supports /dev/systrace. \
			A systrace-capable kernel can be grabbed from: \
