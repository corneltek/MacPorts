long_description The Blackened IRC client is based off of the ircII-2.8.2 \
		 source code and is designed for use by IRC server operators \
		 and administrators.  A number of common IRC operator \
		 utilities have been written directly into Blackened to help \
		 free the need for bulky scripts.
