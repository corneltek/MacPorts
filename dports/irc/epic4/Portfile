long_description \
    EPIC4 is a new direction in ircII development. No \
    longer is EPIC 100% backwards compatible with ircII, \
    but instead those things where compatibility is \
    undesirable have been found and fixed. No gratuitous \
    incompatibilities have been added, but lots of new \
    code has been added to make EPIC the best ircII client \
    available.
