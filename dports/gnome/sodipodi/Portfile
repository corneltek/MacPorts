description	Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program.
long_description        Sodipodi is a vector-based drawing program, like \
			CorelDraw or Adobe Illustrator from the proprietary \
			software world, and Sketch or Karbon14 from the free \
			software world. It is free software, distributed under \
			the terms of the Gnu General Public License, Version 2. \
			Sodipodi uses W3C SVG as its native file format. It is \
			therefore a very useful tool for web designers. It has \
			a relatively modern display engine, giving you finely \
			antialiased display, alpha transparencies, vector fonts \
			and so on. Sodipodi is written in C, using the Gtk+ \
			toolkit and optionally some Gnome libraries. Sodipodi \
			works under most versions of Unix and Windows.
