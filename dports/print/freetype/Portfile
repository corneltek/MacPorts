description	Free and portable render engine for TrueType fonts
long_description	The FreeType engine is a free and portable TrueType font rendering \
			engine.  It  has been developed to  provide TT support  to a great \
			variety of platforms and environments. \
			Notice that  FreeType is a *library*.   It is *not*  a font server \
			for  your preferred environment,  even though  it was  designed to \
			allow the design of many font servers.
