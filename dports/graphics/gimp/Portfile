description	GNU Image Manipulation Program
long_description	The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a powerful tool for the \
			preparation and manipulation of digital images.  The GIMP provides the user \
			with a wide variety of image manipulation, painting, processing, and \
			rendering tools.  The key to the GIMP's power lies in its flexible \
			core and easily extensible design.  The GIMP's open design and \
			extensible architecture make for a very powerful end product which can \
			continue to be extended to meet the needs of the photo compositor, \
			image retoucher, web graphics designer, or digital illustrator for a \
			very long time.
