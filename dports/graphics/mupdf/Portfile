description         lightweight PDF and XPS viewer and parser/rendering library

long_description    MuPDF is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer and \
                    parser/rendering library. \
                    \
                    The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high-quality \
                    anti-aliased graphics. It renders text with metrics and \
                    spacing accurate to within fractions of a pixel for the \
                    highest fidelity in reproducing the look of a printed \
                    page on screen. \
                    \
                    MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports \
                    PDF 1.7 with transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, \
                    annotations, search and many other bells and whistles. \
                    MuPDF can also read XPS documents (OpenXPS ECMA-388).
