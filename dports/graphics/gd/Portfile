description	GD creates PNG and JPEG images, among other formats
long_description	gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images \
			complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from \
			other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a .PNG file. \
			This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where .PNG \
			is the format used for inline images. \
			gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, you \
			are looking in the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are \
			looking in the wrong place.
