description	An X11 based presentation tool.
long_description Magic Point is an X11 based presentation tool. It \
 is designed to make simple presentations easy while to make complicated \
 presentations possible.  Its presentation file (whose suffix is \
 typically .mgp) is just text so that you can create presentation \
 files quickly with your favorite editor (e.g. Emacs, vi).
