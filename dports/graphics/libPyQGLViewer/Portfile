long_description                libQGLViewer is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the \
                                creation of OpenGL 3D viewers. It provides some of the typical \
                                3D viewer functionalities, such as the possibility to move the \
                                camera using the mouse, which lacks in most of the other APIs. \
                                Other features include mouse manipulated frames, interpolated \
                                keyFrames, object selection, stereo display, screenshot saving \
                                and much more. It can be used by OpenGL beginners as well as \
                                to create complex applications, being fully customizable and \
                                easy to extend. \
                                It has been forked to allow running sip on it to create Python wrappers.
