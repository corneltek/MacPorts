description         Post-processing scanned and photocopied book pages
long_description    unpaper is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper, especially for book pages that have been scanned from previously created photocopies. \
                    The main purpose is to make scanned book pages better readable on screen after conversion to PDF. \
                    Additionally, unpaper might be useful to enhance the quality of scanned pages before performing optical character recognition (OCR).
