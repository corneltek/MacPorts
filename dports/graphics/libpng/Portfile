PortSystem 1.0
name		libpng
version		1.2.5
categories	graphics
maintainers	eric@opendarwin.org
description	Library for manipulating PNG images
long_description	Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a \
			way to reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to support \
			the PNG file format in application programs.  Most users will not \
			have to modify the library significantly, advanced users may want \
			to modify it more.  The library was coded for both users.  All \
			attempts were made to make it as complete as possible, while \
			keeping the code easy to understand.  Currently, this library \
			only supports C.  Support for other languages is being considered.
