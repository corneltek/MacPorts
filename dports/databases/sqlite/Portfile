long_description	SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library. \
			Programs that link the SQLite library can have SQL \
			database access without running a separate RDBMS \
			process.  The distribution comes with a standalone \
			command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used \
			to administer an SQLite database and which serves as \
			an example of how to use the SQLite library.
