description	library for decoding ATSC A/52 streams, aka AC-3 
long_description	\
	It is a free library for decoding ATSC A/52 streams, aka AC-3. The \
	A/52 standard is used in a variety of applications, e.g., digital \
	television and DVD. The main goals in liba52 development are: \
	\
	Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when we use \
	platform-specific optimizations we always have a generic C routine \
	to fall back on. \
	\
	Reuseability - we do not want liba52 to include any project-specific \
	code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very \
	diverse projects. \
	\
	Precision - We are trying to implement all of the A/52 standard, and \
	to have a very precise output by doing all the calculations in \
	floating point. We have a test suite that detects any deviation in \
	the output when compared to previous versions. We do not have access \
	to official A/52 test vectors though, so we have to use our \
	judgement to ensure that such deviations are only intruduced when we \
	fix bugs! \
	\
	Speed - liba52 is really fast, on any modern PC it should take only \
	a few percent of CPU time.
