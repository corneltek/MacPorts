description             Console-based last.fm player

long_description        shell-fm is a lightweight, console-based player for Last.FM radio streams. \
                        It\'s pretty small \
                        and it has most features the \"official\" player has, if not even a few more. \
                        \
                        Additional features are, for example: \
                        network interface (control shell-fm remotely) \
                        autoban (automatically ban all tracks of an artist you don\'t like) \
                        bookmark stations (quickly jump to bookmarked stations with a single key) \
                        ... probably more
