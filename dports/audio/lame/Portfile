long_description	\
	LAME is an educational tool to be used for learning about MP3 \
	encoding. The goal of the LAME project is to use the open source \
	model to improve the psycho acoustics, noise shaping and speed of \
	MP3. LAME is not for everyone - it is distributed as source code \
	only and requires the ability to use a C compiler.
