long_description	\
	SoX (also known as Sound eXchange) translates sound samples between \
	different file formats, and optionally applies various sound \
	effects. SoX is intended as the Swiss Army knife of sound processing \
	tools. It doesn't do anything very well, but sooner or later it \
	comes in very handy.
