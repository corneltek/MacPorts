description	lightweight, completly command line based SMTP email agent
long_description	sendemail is a lightweight, completly command line \
		based, SMTP email agent. If you have the need to send email \
		from a command prompt this tool is perfect. It was designed to \
		be used in bash scripts, Perl programs, and web sites, but it \
		is also quite useful in many other contexts.  sendemail is \
		written in Perl and is unique in that it requires no special \
		modules.
