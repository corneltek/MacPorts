long_description libESMTP is a library to manage posting (or submission of) \
		 electronic mail using SMTP to a preconfigured Mail Transport \
		 Agent (MTA) such as Exim. It may be used as part of a Mail \
		 User Agent (MUA) or another program that must be able to \
		 post electronic mail but where mail functionality is not \
		 that program's primary purpose. libESMTP is not intended \
		 to be used as part of a program that implements a Mail \
		 Transport Agent. It is hoped that the availability of a \
		 lightweight library implementing an SMTP client will both \
		 ease the task of coding for software authors and improve the \
		 quality of the resulting code.
