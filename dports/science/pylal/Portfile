description        Python LSC Algorithm Library
long_description \
  The PyLAL package is best described as the Python LIGO Algorithm \
  Library. It was originally a Python wrapping of parts of the LAL \
  library, and although it continues to provide that function it has \
  acquired a large collection of independent code of its own so that \
  it is no longer exclusively a Python interface to LAL. In this \
  package you will find convenience code to assist with manipulating \
  XML documents using the glue.ligolw I/O library, you will find a \
  wrapping to libframe to enable GWF frame-file reading, you will \
  find binning and smoothing code, and you will find (partial) \
  wrappings of LALs burstsearch, date, inject, tools, and window \
  packages. Additionally, you will find most, if not all, of the \
  inspiral pipeline's follow-up and summary tools, and several \
  burst-related trigger post-production tools.
