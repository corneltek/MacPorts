  Gcal is a program for calculating and printing calendars.  Gcal displays   \
  hybrid and proleptic Julian and Gregorian calendar sheets, respectively    \
  for one month, three months, or a whole year. It also displays eternal     \
  holiday lists for many countries around the globe, and features a very     \
  powerful creation of fixed date liststhat can be used for reminding        \
  purposes.  Gcal can calculate various astronomical data and times of the   \
  Sun and the Moon for pleasure at any location, precisely enough for most   \
  civil purposes. Gcal supports some other calendar systems, for example,    \
  the Chinese and Japanese calendars, the Hebrew calendar, and the civil     \
  Islamic calendar, too.
