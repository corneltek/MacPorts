description         exchange-correlation functionals for DFT

long_description    Libxc is a library of exchange-correlation functionals \
                    for density-functional theory. The aim is to provide a \
                    portable, well tested and reliable set of exchange and \
                    correlation functionals that can be used by all the \
                    ETSF codes and also other codes.
