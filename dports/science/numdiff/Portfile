description         Compare files containing numerical fields.
long_description    When you compare a couple of such files, what you want to \
obtain usually is a list of the numerical fields in the second file which \
numerically differ from the corresponding fields in the first file. Well known \
tools like diff, cmp or wdiff can not be used to this purpose: they can not \
recognize whether a difference between two numerical fields is only due to the \
notation or is actually a difference of numerical values.
