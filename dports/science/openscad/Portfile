description         OpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects
long_description    OpenSCAD is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. \
                    Unlike most free software for creating 3D models (such as the \
                    famous application Blender) it does not focus on the artistic \
                    aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects. Thus \
                    it might be the application you are looking for when you are \
                    planning to create 3D models of machine parts but pretty sure \
                    is not what you are looking for when you are more interested \
                    in creating computer-animated movies. \
                    OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something \
                    like a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes \
                    the object and renders the 3D model from this script file. This \
                    gives you (the designer) full control over the modelling process \
                    and enables you to easily change any step in the modelling process \
                    or make designes that are defined by configurable parameters. \
                    OpenSCAD provides two main modelling techniques: First there is \
                    constructive solid geometry (aka CSG) and second there is extrusion \
                    of 2D outlines. As data exchange format format for this 2D outlines \
                    Autocad DXF files are used. In addition to 2D paths for extrusion \
                    it is also possible to read design parametes from DXF files. Besides \
                    DXF files OpenSCAD can read and create 3D models in the STL and OFF \
                    file formats.
