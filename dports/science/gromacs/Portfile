long_description	GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular \
	dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations of motion for \
	systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily \
	designed for biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids that \
	have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is \
	extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that \
	usually dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for \
	research on non-biological systems, e.g. polymers.
