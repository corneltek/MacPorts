description	GNU TeXmacs: A Scientific Text Editor
long_description	\
		GNU TeXmacs is a free scientific text editor, \
		which was both inspired by TeX and GNU Emacs. \
		The editor allows you to write structured documents \
		via a wysiwyg (what-you-see-is-what-you-get) and \
		user friendly interface. New styles may be created by \
		the user. The program implements high-quality \
		typesetting algorithms and TeX fonts, which help you \
		to produce professionally looking documents.  \
								\
		The high typesetting quality still goes through for \
		automatically generated formulas, which makes TeXmacs \
		suitable as an interface for computer algebra systems. \
		TeXmacs also supports the Guile/Scheme extension language, \
		so that you may customize the interface and write your \
		own extensions to the editor. 

#user_notes	If texmacs can't find guile's modules, you will have to \
#		set GUILE_LOAD_PATH explicitly (usually /opt/local/share/guile/1.6). \
#		Also, don't forget to set DISPLAY to localhost:0.0 if \
#		launching TeXmacs from a non-X11 terminal.
