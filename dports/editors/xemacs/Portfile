description	The XEmacs editor, based on GNU Emacs
long_description	GNU Emacs is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time display editor. \
			Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly \
			by studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features. \
			Emacs also has an extensive interactive manual browser.  It is easily \
			extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.  XEmacs adds many extensions to GNU Emacs to take particilar advantage of the X Window System.
