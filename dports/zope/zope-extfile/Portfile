description         This is the ExtFile/ExtImage Zope Product.
long_description    The ExtFile Product stores large files in an \
                    external file-repository and is able to display \
                    icons for different MIME-Types.  The ExtImage \
                    Product additionally creates preview-thumbnails from \
                    various images and displays them.  ExtFile and \
                    ExtImage basically work like the Zope File and Image \
                    products. The difference is, that the File/Image \
                    Products stores the (binary) file inside the ZODB, \
                    wheras ExtFile/ExtImage stores it externally in a \
                    repository directory (default: <zope-dir>/var/reposit). \
                    Only meta data (like title and description) are \
                    stored in the Database. This prevents the Database \
                    swelling up quickly, when many large files are \
                    uploaded and thus increasing database performance.
