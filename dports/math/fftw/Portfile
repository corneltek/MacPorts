description	Fast C routines to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform
long_description	\
	FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the Discrete Fourier \
	Transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions, of both real and complex \
	data, and of arbitrary input size. We believe that FFTW, which is \
	free software, should become the FFT library of choice for most \
	applications. Our benchmarks, performed on a variety of platforms, \
	show that FFTW's performance is typically superior to that of other \
	publicly available FFT software. Moreover, FFTW's performance is \
	portable: the program will perform well on most architectures \
	without modification.
