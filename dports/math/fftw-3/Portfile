description	Fast C routines to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform
long_description	\
		FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the	\
		Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) in one or more		\
		dimensions, of both real and complex data, and of	\
		arbitrary input size. We believe that FFTW, which is	\
		free software, should become the FFT library of choice	\
		for most applications. Our benchmarks, performed on a	\
		variety of platforms, show that FFTW's performance is	\
		typically superior to that of other publicly available	\
		FFT software. Moreover, FFTW's performance is portable:	\
		the program will perform well on most architectures	\
		without modification.					\
									\
		This port is of fftw version 3.x. It has many		\
		improvements relative to 2.x, but is not backwardly	\
		compatible.
