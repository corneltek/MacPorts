description		Library allowing Ruby apps to talk to a Jabber IM system. 
long_description	This library was created to allow a Ruby application to \
					connect to (or create a) Jabber account as an additional \
					resource. Although it was not the original intent to serve \
					as the infrastructure of a complete UI-based IM client... \
					it supports everything except the groupchat protocol. \
					It currently supports: \
						Account registration \
						Connection to an account (digest and plain text) \
						Access to Roster (buddy list) \
						Tracking of presence of resources in the Roster \
							(including local account resources) \
						Sending and receiving messages \
						Managing subscriptions \
						XHTML messages \
						Pluggable XML Parsers \
					What can you do with this? You could write a ruby \
					application that allows you to query it by IM for status, \
					control, etc. You could use this as a communications \
					channel backbone for a Ruby application (which is my intent).
