description       Command line tools for EC2 and S3 API's.
long_description  Euca2ools are command-line tools for interacting with Web \
                  services that export a REST/Query-based API compatible with \
                  Amazon EC2 and S3 services.The tools can be used with both \
                  Amazon's services and with installations of the Eucalyptus \
                  open-source cloud-computing infrastructure. The tools were \
                  inspired by command-line tools distributed by Amazon \
                  (api-tools and ami-tools) and largely accept the same \
                  options and environment variables.
