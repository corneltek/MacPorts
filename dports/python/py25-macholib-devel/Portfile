long_description \
    This is a stub port. Install $replaced_by instead. \
    macholib can be used to analyze and edit Mach-O headers, the executable \
    format used by Mac OS X. \
    It is typically used as a dependency analysis tool, and also to rewrite \
    dylib references in Mach-O headers to be @executable_path relative. \
    Though this tool targets a platform specific file format, it is pure \
    python code that is platform and endian independent.
