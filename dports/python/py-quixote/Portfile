long_description	Quixote is a framework for developing Web applications \
			in Python. Its design goals were to allow easy \
			development of Web applications where the accent is \
			more on complicated programming logic than complicated \
			templating, to make the templating language as similar \
			to Python as possible. The aim is to make as many of \
			the skills and techniques learned from writing regular \
			Python code applicable to the task of writing Web \
			applications.
