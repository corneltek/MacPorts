description       Fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python
long_description  \
  This module implements a very fast JSON encoder/decoder for Python. \
  \
  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a text based \
  lightweight data exchange format which is easy for humans to \
  read/write and for machines to parse/generate. JSON is \
  completely language independent and has multiple implementations \
  in most of the programming languages, making it ideal for data \
  exchange and storage. \
  \
  The module is written in C and it is up to 250 times faster when \
  compared to the other python JSON implementations which are written \
  directly in python. This speed gain varies with the complexity of \
  the data and the operation and is the the range of 10-200 times for \
  encoding operations and in the range of 100-250 times for decoding \
  operations.
