description			python module for parsing and building binary or textual data structures
long_description	Construct is a python library for parsing and building of data structures \
					(binary or textual). It is based on the concept of defining data \
					structures in a declarative manner, rather than procedural code: more \
					complex constructs are composed of a hierarchy of simpler ones.
