    Werkzeug \
    ======== \
    \
    Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI \
    applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility \
    modules.  It includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and \
    response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control \
    headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL \
    routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules. \
    \
    Werkzeug is unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template \
    engine, database adapter or anything else.  It doesn't even enforce \
    a specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the \
    developer. It's most useful for end user applications which should work \
    on as many server environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis, \
    bulletin boards, etc.). \
    \
    Details and example applications are available on the \
    `Werkzeug website <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_. \
    \
    \
    Features \
    -------- \
    \
    -   unicode awareness \
    -   request and response objects \
    -   various utility functions for dealing with HTTP headers such as \
        `Accept` and `Cache-Control` headers. \
    -   thread local objects with proper cleanup at request end \
    -   an interactive debugger \
    -   wrapper around wsgiref that works around some of the limitations \
        and bugs, adds threading and fork support for test environments \
        and adds an automatic reloader. \
    -   a flexible URL routing system with REST support. \
    -   fully WSGI compatible \
    \
