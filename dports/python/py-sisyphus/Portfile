name		py-sisyphus
version		0.8
categories	devel
maintainers	mww@opendarwin.org
description	python module for running python stuff as cron jobs
long_description	This module simplifies running Python stuff as cron \
		jobs. There will be no more than one sisyphus job of a certain \
		name running at every given time. When the job is already \
		running and a second is started, the second one will quit \
		immediately if the first one hasn't exceeded its maximum \
		allowed lifetime yet. If it has exceeded the allowed lifetime \
		the first job will be killed and the second will start \
		running. In addition to that, logging features are provided.
