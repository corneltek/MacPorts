long_description    ${description}. \
                    Spyder provides a powerful interactive development \
                    environment for the Python language with advanced \
                    editing, interactive testing, debugging and introspection \
                    features as well as a numerical computing environment \
                    thanks to the support of IPython (enhanced interactive \
                    Python interpreter) and popular Python libraries such as \
                    NumPy (linear algebra), SciPy (signal and image \
                    processing) or matplotlib (interactive 2D/3D plotting) \
                    development environment with advanced editing, \
                    interactive testing, debugging and introspection features.
