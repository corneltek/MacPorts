description         Python framework for processing seismological data

long_description    ObsPy is an open-source project dedicated to provide a Python \
                    framework for processing seismological data. It provides \
                    parsers for common file formats and seismological signal \
                    processing routines which allow the manipulation of \
                    seismological time series. The goal of the ObsPy project is \
                    to facilitate rapid application development for seismology. \
                    \
                    This port installs the ObsPy package obspy.core. It contains \
                    common classes and methods like UTCDateTime, Stats, Stream \
                    and Trace  well as methods for reading and writing \
                    seismograms which are required by other ObsPy packages.
