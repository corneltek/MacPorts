description         Error (and style) checking for python
long_description \
    Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in python code, and tries to \
    check that a given coding standard is respected by the coders. This is \
    similar but nevertheless different from what pychecker_ provides, \
    especially since pychecker explicitely does not bother with coding \
    style. The default coding style used by pylint is close to `Guido's \
    style guide`_.
