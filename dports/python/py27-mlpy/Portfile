description         Python package for predictive modeling
long_description    \
    mlpy is a high-performance Python package for predictive modeling. \
    It makes extensive use of NumPy (http://scipy.org) to provide fast \
    N-dimensional array manipulation and easy integration of C code. mlpy \
    provides high level procedures that support, with few lines of code, \
    the design of rich Data Analysis Protocols (DAPs) for preprocessing, \
    clustering, predictive classification and feature selection. Methods \
    are available for feature weighting and ranking, data resampling, \
    error evaluation and experiment landscaping. The package includes \
    tools to measure stability in sets of ranked feature lists.
