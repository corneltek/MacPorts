description     Python module for loading and referencing test data

long_description \
    Fixtures defines a Python contract for reusable state / support logic, \
    primarily for unit testing. Helper and adaption logic is included to make \
    it easy to write your own fixtures using the fixtures contract. Glue code \
    is provided that makes using fixtures that meet the Fixtures contract in \
    unittest compatible test cases easy and straight forward.
