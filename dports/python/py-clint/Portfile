description     Clint is a module filled with a set of awesome tools for developing commandline applications
long_description    C ommand L ine IN terface T ools .\
                    Clint is awesome. Crazy awesome. It supports colors, but detects if the session is a TTY, \
                    so doesn't render the colors if you're piping stuff around. Automagically.\
                    Awesome nest-able indentation context manager. Example: (with indent(4): puts('indented text')). \
                    It supports custom email-style quotes. Of course, it supports color too, if and when needed.\
                    It has an awesome Column printer with optional auto-expanding columns. \
                    It detects how wide your current console is and adjusts accordingly. \
                    It wraps your words properly to fit the column size. \
                    With or without colors mixed in. \
                    All with a single function call.\
                    The world's easiest to use implicit argument system w/ chaining methods for filtering. Seriously.
