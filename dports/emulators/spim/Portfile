long_description   SPIM S20 is a software simulator that runs assembly language programs for\
the MIPS R2000/R3000 RISC computers.  SPIM can read and immediately run\
files containing assembly language statements.  SPIM is a self-contained\
system for running these programs and contains a debugger and interface to\
the operating system.\
\
SPIM implements almost the entire MIPS assembler-extended instruction set\
for the R2000/R3000 (I've omitted some the complex floating point comparisons\
and details of the memory system page tables).  The MIPS architecture has\
evolved considerably since then (in particular the 64 bit extensions), which\
means that SPIM will not run programs compiled for recent MIPS or SGI\
processors.\
