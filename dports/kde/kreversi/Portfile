description         KReversi is a simple one player strategy game played against \
                    the computer. 
long_description    ${description} If a player's piece is captured by an opposing \
                    player, that piece is turned over to reveal the color of that \
                    player. A winner is declared when one player has more pieces of \
                    his own color on the board and there are no more possible moves.
