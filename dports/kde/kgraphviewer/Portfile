description         GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE
long_description    KGraphViewer is a GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE. \
                    The graphviz program suite is a free software set of \
                    layout engines for graphs. They are commonly used in \
                    scientific domains and particularly in computer science. \
                    But until now there was a lack of a modern GUI to look \
                    at the graphs. KGraphViewer is aimed at replacing these \
                    tools with a modern user-friendly GUI with all the power \
                    of a well integrated KDE application.
