description	Objective Caml interface to gtk+
long_description	\
	LablGTK is is an Objective Caml interface to gtk+. \
	\
	It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a \
	strongly typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to \
	gtk+. This is not that easy if you know the dynamic typing approach \
	taken by gtk+.
