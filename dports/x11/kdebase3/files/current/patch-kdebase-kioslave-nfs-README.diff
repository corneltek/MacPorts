+Darwin notes --
+
+It looks like there are C++ type issues with the Darwin headers
+(try building, you'll see the "too many arguments to function" stuff)
+
+The problem seems to be <rpc/clnt.h> having definitions that don't
+play nice with C++.  The client rpc handle does a bunch of void stuff
+in the struct which is fine in C but makes an empty arg list in C++.
+
+typedef struct {
+        AUTH    *cl_auth;                       /* authenticator */
+        struct clnt_ops {
+                enum clnt_stat  (*cl_call)();   /* call remote procedure */
+                void            (*cl_abort)();  /* abort a call */
+                void            (*cl_geterr)(); /* get specific error code */
+                bool_t          (*cl_freeres)(); /* frees results */
+                void            (*cl_destroy)();/* destroy this structure */
+                bool_t          (*cl_control)();/* the ioctl() of rpc */
+        } *cl_ops;
+        caddr_t                 cl_private;     /* private stuff */
+} CLIENT;
+
+
+The only solution is to probably reimplement clnt.h locally to fix
+these (wrapping the "#include <rpc/rpc.h>" in an extern "C" isn't enough).
