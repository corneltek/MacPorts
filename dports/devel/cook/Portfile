description   Cook is a replacement for the traditional make(1) tool.
long_description   Cook is a tool for constructing files. It is given a \
		set of files to create, and recipes of how to create \
		them. In any non-trivial program there will be \
		prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to \
		creating any file, such as include files. Cook provides \
		a mechanism to define these.
