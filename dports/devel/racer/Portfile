# the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH is ugly but currently the only way to have
# rust find the libraries installed via rpath; using install_name_tool wouldn't
# help in this situation because rust and cargo both download binaries to
# bootstrap themselves. Since this is just a build argument, I think it's fine
# for now.
