description             \
    This package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing \
    streams of data represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib C library \
    so it has high performance. It supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\" \
    compression formats.
long_description        ${description} \
    It provides a convenient high level API suitable for most tasks and for the \
    few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib \
    feature set.
