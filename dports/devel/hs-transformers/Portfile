description     Concrete monad transformers

long_description \
    Haskell 98 part of a monad transformer library, inspired by the paper \
    \"Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism\" \
    by Mark P Jones, in Advanced School of Functional Programming, 1995 \
    (http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/springschool.html). This part contains \
    the monad transformer class, the concrete monad transformers, operations \
    and liftings. It can be used on its own in Haskell 98 code, or with the \
    monad classes in the monads-fd or monads-tf packages, which automatically \
    lift operations introduced by monad transformers through other transformers.
