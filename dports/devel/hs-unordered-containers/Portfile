description         Efficient hashing-based container types
long_description    Efficient hashing-based container types. The \
                    containers have been optimized for performance \
                    critical use, both in terms of large data quantities \
                    and high speed. The declared cost of each operation \
                    is either worst-case or amortized, but remains valid \
                    even if structures are shared.
