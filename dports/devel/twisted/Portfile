description	Event-based Python framework for internet apps
long_description	\
	Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.  It \
	includes a web server, a telnet server, a chat server, a news \
	server, a generic client and server for remote object access, and \
	APIs for creating new protocols and services. Twisted supports \
	integration of the Tk, GTK+, Qt or wxPython event loop with its main \
	event loop. The Win32 event loop is also supported, as is basic \
	support for running servers on top of Jython. Twisted works with \
	Python 2.1 and Python 2.2. Twisted even supports the CVS versions of \
	Python, so it is ready for Python 2.3.
