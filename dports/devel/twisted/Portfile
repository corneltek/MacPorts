description	An event-based Python framework for internet applications
long_description	\
  Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications.  It includes a \
  web server, a telnet server, a chat server, a news server, a generic client \
  and server for remote object access, and APIs for creating new protocols and \
  services. Twisted supports integration of the Tk, GTK+, Qt or wxPython event \
  loop with its main event loop. The Win32 event loop is also supported, as is \
  basic support for running servers on top of Jython. Twisted works with \
  Python 2.1 and Python 2.2. Twisted even supports the CVS versions of Python, \
  so it is ready for Python 2.3.
