description             \
    A portable library of functor and monad transformers, inspired by the paper \
    Functional Programming with Overloading and Higher-Order Polymorphism, by \
    Mark P Jones, in Advanced School of Functional Programming, 1995
long_description        ${description} \
    This package contains:\n\
     - the monad transformer class (in Control.Monad.Trans.Class)\n\
     - concrete functor and monad transformers, each with associated operations \
       and functions to lift operations associated with other transformers.\n\
    It can be used on its own in portable Haskell code, or with the monad \
    classes in the mtl or monads-tf packages, which automatically lift \
    operations introduced by monad transformers through other transformers.
