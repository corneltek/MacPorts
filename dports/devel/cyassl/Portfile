description         CyaSSL Embedded SSL Library

long_description    \
    The CyaSSL embedded SSL library is a lightweight SSL library written \
    in ANSI C and targeted for embedded and RTOS environments - primarily \
    because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly \
    used in standard operating environments as well because of its \
    royalty-free pricing and excellent cross platform support.  CyaSSL \
    supports industry standards up to the current TLS and DTLS 1.2 levels, \
    is up to 20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers \
    such as HC-128, RABBIT, and NTRU.
