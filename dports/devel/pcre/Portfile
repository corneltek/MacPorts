description      Perl Compatible Regular Expressions Library
long_description \
    The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular \
    expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics \
    as Perl, with just a few differences. The current implementation \
    of PCRE (release 4.x) corresponds approximately with Perl 5.8, \
    including support for UTF-8 encoded strings.
