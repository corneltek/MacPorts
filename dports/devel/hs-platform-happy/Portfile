description             \
    Happy is a parser generator system for Haskell, similar to the tool `yacc' \
    for C. Like `yacc', it takes a file containing an annotated BNF \
    specification of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing \
    a parser for the grammar.
long_description        ${description} \
    Happy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers in the same program, \
    and several entry points to a single grammar. Happy can work in conjunction \
    with a lexical analyser supplied by the user (either hand-written or \
    generated by another program), or it can parse a stream of characters \
    directly (but this isn't practical in most cases).
