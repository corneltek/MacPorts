description	libIDL is a library for creating CORBA IDL files. 
long_description       	libIDL is a library licensed under the GNU LGPL \
			for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition \
			Language (IDL) files, which is a specification \
			for defining portable interfaces. libIDL was \
			initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the \
			GNOME project, and the primary means of libIDL \
			distribution).  However, the functionality was \
			designed to be as reusable and portable as possible.
