description         definitions for the Pandoc data structure in Haskell
long_description    \
    This package contains definitions for the Pandoc data structure, which \
    is used by pandoc to represent structured documents. These definitions \
    used to live in the pandoc package, but starting with pandoc 1.7, they \
    have been split off, so that other packages can use them without drawing \
    in all of pandoc's dependencies, and pandoc itself can depend on packages \
    (like citeproc-hs) that use them.
