description			OSSP mm - Shared Memory Allocation

long_description \
	OSSP mm is a 2-layer abstraction library which simplifies the usage of \
	shared memory between forked (and this way strongly related) processes \
	under Unix platforms. On the first (lower) layer it hides all platform \
	dependent implementation details (allocation and locking) when dealing \
	with shared memory segments and on the second (higher) layer it \
	provides a high-level malloc(3)-style API for a convenient and well \
	known way to work with data-structures inside those shared memory \
	segments.
