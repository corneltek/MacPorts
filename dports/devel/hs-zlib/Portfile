description         Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib \
                    formats
long_description    This package provides a pure interface for \
                    compressing and decompressing streams of data \
                    represented as lazy ByteStrings. It uses the zlib \
                    C library so it has high performance. It supports \
                    the zlib, gzip and raw compression formats. It \
                    provides a convenient high level API suitable for \
                    most tasks and for the few cases where more control \
                    is needed it provides access to the full zlib \
                    feature set.
