long_description \
        DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. \
        Its purpose is to provide a single front end for all \
        tests. Think of it as a custom library of Tcl \
        procedures crafted to support writing a test harness. \
        A Test Harness is the testing infrastructure that is \
        created to support a specific program or tool. Each \
        program can have multiple testsuites, all supported \
        by a single test harness.
