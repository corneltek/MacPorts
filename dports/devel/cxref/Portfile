description         C cross referencing & documenting tool
long_description    Cxref is a program that will produce documentation \
                    (in LaTeX, HTML, RTF or SGML) including \
                    cross-references from C program source code. It has \
                    been designed to work with ANSI C, incorporating \
                    K&R, and most popular GNU extensions. The \
                    documentation for the program is produced from \
                    comments in the code that are appropriately \
                    formatted. The cross referencing comes from the code \
                    itself and requires no extra work.
