description	GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
long_description	GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating on \
			signed integers, rational numbers, and floating point numbers.  It has a \
			rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular interface. \
			GNU MP is designed to be as fast as possible, both for small operands and \
			for huge operands.  The speed is achieved by using fullwords as the basic \
			arithmetic type, by using fast algorithms, by carefully optimized assembly \
			code for the most common inner loops for a lots of CPUs, and by a general \
			emphasis on speed (instead of simplicity or elegance).
