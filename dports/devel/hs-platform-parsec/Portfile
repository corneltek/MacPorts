description             \
    Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser library. \
    It is simple, safe, well documented (on the package homepage), has \
    extensive libraries and good error messages, and is also fast. It is \
    defined as a monad transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, \
    and it is also parametric in the input stream type.
