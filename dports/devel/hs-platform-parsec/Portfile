description	Monadic parser combinators for Haskell (platform version)
long_description	\
	Parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength \
	parser library. It is simple, safe, well documented, has \
	extensive libraries and good error messages, and is also \
	fast. It is defined as a monad transformer that can be \
	stacked on arbitrary monads, and it is also parametric \
	in the input stream type.
