long_description \
    Make is a tool which controls the generation of executables and     \
    other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.\
    Make gets its knowledge of how to build your program from a file    \
    called the makefile, which lists each of the non-source files and   \
    how to compute it from other files. When you write a program, you   \
    should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to use Make  \
    to build and install the program.
