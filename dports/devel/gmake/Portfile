long_description   Make is a tool which controls the generation of \
	           executables and other non-source files of a program from \
		   the program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of \
		   how to build your program from a file called the makefile, \
		   which lists each of the non-source files and how to \
		   compute it from other files. When you write a program, you \
		   should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to \
		   use Make to build and install the program.
