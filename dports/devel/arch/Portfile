description      GNU arch - revision control system
long_description \
    GNU arch is a revision control system, similar in purpose to \
    tools such as CVS, SCCS, and Subversion. It is used to keep \
    track of the changes made to a source tree and to help \
    programmers combine and otherwise manipulate changes made by \
    multiple people or at different times.
