description         A modern C++ library providing numerical abstractions

long_description    The Parma Polyhedra Library (PPL) is a modern C++ library \
                    providing numerical abstractions especially targeted at \
                    applications in the field of analysis and verification of \
                    complex systems. The PPL can handle all the convex \
                    polyhedra that can be defined as the intersection of a \
                    finite number of (open or closed) hyperspaces, each \
                    described by an equality or inequality (strict or \
                    non-strict) with rational coefficients. The PPL also \
                    handles restricted classes of polyhedra that offer \
                    interesting complexity/precision tradeoffs. The library \
                    also supports finite powersets of (any kind of) polyhedra \
                    and linear programming problems solved with an \
                    exact-arithmetic version of the simplex algorithm.
