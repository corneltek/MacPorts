description             llvm is a next generation compiler infrastructure (svn trunk version)
long_description        The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and \
                        target-independent optimizer, along with code \
                        generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as \
                        some less common ones!) These libraries are built \
                        around a well specified code representation known as \
                        the LLVM intermediate representation ("LLVM IR").
