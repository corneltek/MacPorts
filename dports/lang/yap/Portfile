long_description	\
		YAP is a high-performance Prolog compiler developed at 	\
		LIACC/Universidade do Porto and at COPPE Sistemas/UFRJ.	\
		Its Prolog engine is based in the WAM (Warren Abstract 	\
		Machine), with several optimizations for better 	\
		performance. YAP follows the Edinburgh tradition, and 	\
		is largely compatible with the ISO-Prolog standard and 	\
		with Quintus and SICStus Prolog.
