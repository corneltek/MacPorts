description         AB-Transfers allows to carry out bank transactions online. It is meant to complement KMyMoney and GnuCash.
long_description    AB-Transfers allows to carry out bank transactions online. It is not indented to become a full-fledged \
                    financial application like KMyMoney or GnuCash, but is meant to be used in parallel to them. \
                    This application can execute transactions which are not (yet) supported by those applications and thus complements them. \
                    AB-Transfers is meant for private use and it is not planned to implement functions which make sense for business use. \
                    AB-Transfers makes use of the AqBanking tool. All transaction types known to AqBanking are supported and should be \
                    usable in AB-Transfers. \
                    NOTE: Currently the application is not internationalized, i.e. the UI is only in German.
