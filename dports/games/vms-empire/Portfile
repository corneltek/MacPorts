long_description \
    Empire is a simulation of a full-scale war between two emperors, the \
    computer and you. Naturally, there is only room for one, so the object \
    of the game is to destroy the other. The computer plays by the same \
    rules that you do. This game is the ancestor of all the multiplayer \
    Empire simulations out there.
