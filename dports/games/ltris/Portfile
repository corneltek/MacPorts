description	Tetris clone with multiplayer and AI support.
long_description	LTris as a tetris clone which means you have a bowl \
			with blocks falling down. By rotating and moving the \
			blocks you try to assemble whole lines which then \
			disappear. LTris has three modes for this: Classic is \
			the classical one where you play until the bowl \
			becomes filled, Figures resets the bowl contents to a \
			new figure for each level and adds suddenly appearing \
			tiles and lines later on and Multiplayer where up to \
			three players either controlled by human or CPU(!) \
			compete and send completed lines to each other.
