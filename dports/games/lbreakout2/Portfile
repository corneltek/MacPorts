long_description	The successor to LBreakout offers you a new challenge \
			in more than 50 levels with loads of new bonuses \
			(goldshower, joker, explosive balls, bonus magnet \
			...), maluses (chaos, darkness, weak balls, malus \
			magnet ...) and special bricks (growing bricks, \
			explosive bricks, regenerative bricks ...). If you \
			are still hungry for more after that you can create \
			your own levelsets with the integrated level editor. \
