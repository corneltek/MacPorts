description		    library for manipulating Unicode strings
long_description	\
    Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may consist of \
    very different scripts – from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi –, with many \
    kinds of special characters – accents, right-to-left writing marks, \
    hyphens, Roman numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform APIs for \
    text do not contain adequate functions for dealing with particular \
    properties of many Unicode characters. In fact, the POSIX APIs for text \
    have several assumptions at their base which don't hold for Unicode text. \
    This library provides functions for manipulating Unicode strings and for \
    manipulating C strings according to the Unicode standard.
