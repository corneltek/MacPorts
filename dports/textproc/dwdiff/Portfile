description         diff program that operates at the word level
long_description    \
    dwdiff is a front-end for the diff program that operates at the word level \
    instead of the line level. It is different from wdiff in that it allows \
    the user to specify what should be considered whitespace, and in that it \
    takes an optional list of characters that should be considered delimiters. \
    Delimiters are single characters that are treated as if they are words, \
    even when there is no whitespace separating them from preceding words or \
    delimiters. dwdiff is mostly commandline compatible with wdiff. Only the \
    --autopager, --terminal and --avoid-wraps options are not supported.
