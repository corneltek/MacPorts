description	GNU version of the stream editor, sed
long_description	Sed (streams editor) isn't really a true text editor \
					or text processor. Instead, it is used to filter text, \
					i.e., it takes text input and performs some operation \
					(or set of operations) on it and outputs the modified \
					text. Sed is typically used for extracting part of a \
					file using pattern matching or substituting multiple \
					occurances of a string within a file.
