description       php5 extension for PHP acceleration, optimization, and dynamic content caching
long_description \
    eAccelerator is a free open-source PHP accelerator, optimizer, and dynamic \
    content cache. It increases the performance of PHP scripts by caching them \
    in their compiled state, so that the overhead of compiling is almost \
    completely eliminated. It also optimizes scripts to speed up their \
    execution. eAccelerator typically reduces server load and increases the \
    speed of your PHP code by 1-10 times.
