The A/52 standard is used in a variety of applications, e.g., digital television and DVD. The main goals in liba52 development are: Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when we use platform-specific optimizations we always have a generic C routine to fall back on. Reuseability - we do not want liba52 to include any project-specific code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very diverse projects. Precision - We are trying to implement all of the A/52 standard, and to have a very precise output by doing all the calculations in floating point. We have a test suite that detects any deviation in the output when compared to previous versions. We do not have access to official A/52 test vectors though, so we have to use our judgement to ensure that such deviations are only intruduced when we fix bugs! Speed - liba52 is really fast, on any modern PC it should take only a few percent of CPU time.}

If you've always wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that annoying GPS wander, but didn't want to spend the money for a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away.

In hardcopy, the ANSI Common Lisp standard is nearly 1100 printed pages describing nearly a thousand functions and variables in sufficient detail to accommodate hosting of the language on a wide variety of hardware and operating system platforms. While the paper version remains the official standard, we think that in practice you'll find the Common Lisp HyperSpec much easier to navigate and use than its paper alternative.
