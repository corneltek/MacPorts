Reuseability - we do not want liba52 to include any project-specific code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very diverse projects. Precision - We are trying to implement all of the A/52 standard, and to have a very precise output by doing all the calculations in floating point. We have a test suite that detects any deviation in the output when compared to previous versions. We do not have access to official A/52 test vectors though, so we have to use our judgement to ensure that such deviations are only intruduced when we fix bugs! Speed - liba52 is really fast, on any modern PC it should take only a few percent of CPU time.}

If you've always wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that annoying GPS wander, but didn't want to spend the money for a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away.

The most common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt.
