Reuseability - we do not want liba52 to include any project-specific code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very diverse projects. Precision - We are trying to implement all of the A/52 standard, and to have a very precise output by doing all the calculations in floating point. We have a test suite that detects any deviation in the output when compared to previous versions. We do not have access to official A/52 test vectors though, so we have to use our judgement to ensure that such deviations are only intruduced when we fix bugs! Speed - liba52 is really fast, on any modern PC it should take only a few percent of CPU time.}

If you've always wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that annoying GPS wander, but didn't want to spend the money for a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away.

While the paper version remains the official standard, we think that in practice you'll find the Common Lisp HyperSpec much easier to navigate and use than its paper alternative.

This cipher is believed to provide very strong security. Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files around.

But you can turn this off with the -i switch. It supports any terminal capable of handling VT100 style escape codes. Spinner is useful for keeping telnet and ssh links from dropping due to inactivity. Many firewalls, and some ISPs drop connections when they are perceived as idle. By having spinner running the server is constantly sending a tiny amount of data over the link, preserving the connection. Thus Spinner is an anti-dle, timeout preventing, background daemon process for unix variants including linux.}
