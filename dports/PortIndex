Reuseability - we do not want liba52 to include any project-specific code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very diverse projects. Precision - We are trying to implement all of the A/52 standard, and to have a very precise output by doing all the calculations in floating point. We have a test suite that detects any deviation in the output when compared to previous versions. We do not have access to official A/52 test vectors though, so we have to use our judgement to ensure that such deviations are only intruduced when we fix bugs!

If you've always wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that annoying GPS wander, but didn't want to spend the money for a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away. Several respondents from 2000 miles away have noted that the remote differential signals have diminished the SA-induced position and velocity errors by approximately 3 times.}

Kings are high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces). When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14.

In hardcopy, the ANSI Common Lisp standard is nearly 1100 printed pages describing nearly a thousand functions and variables in sufficient detail to accommodate hosting of the language on a wide variety of hardware and operating system platforms. While the paper version remains the official standard, we think that in practice you'll find the Common Lisp HyperSpec much easier to navigate and use than its paper alternative.

This cipher is believed to provide very strong security. Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files around. In addition, there is a compatibility mode for decrypting legacy unix crypt files.}
