If you've always wanted to know exactly where your house is located without that annoying GPS wander, but didn't want to spend the money for a DGPS radio, here is your big chance! I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away. Several respondents from 2000 miles away have noted that the remote differential signals have diminished the SA-induced position and velocity errors by approximately 3 times.}

It provides a portable and simplified interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application programmer such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header information, byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality. Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped up with little effort. With a bit more time, more complex programs can be written (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten using libnet and libpcap).}

This cipher is believed to provide very strong security. Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files around.
