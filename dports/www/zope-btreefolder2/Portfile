description	Zope folder that can contain many more objects efficiently
long_description	When you fill a Zope folder with too many \
			objects, both Zope and your browser get \
			overwhelmed. Zope has to load and store a large \
			folder object, and the browser has to render \
			large HTML tables repeatedly. Zope can store a \
			lot of objects, but it has trouble storing a lot \
			of objects in a single standard Zope folder. \
			BTreeFolder2 solves this problem by storing the \
			objects in Zope BTrees, special structures \
			designed for the Zope object database. BTrees \
			can hold numerous items without loading them all \
			into memory at once.
