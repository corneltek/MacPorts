long_description        The serf library is a C-based HTTP client library \
                        built upon the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) \
                        library.  It multiplexes connections, running the \
                        read/write communication asynchronously.  Memory \
                        copies and transformations are kept to a minimum to \
                        provide high performance operation.
