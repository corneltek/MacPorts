    # upgrades to 1.4.23, spawn-fcgi will be installed first, which would cause
    # a conflict on these files at activation time. Therefore tell the user to
    # first deactivate their old lighttpd.
    # Note: lighttpd.1 is only installed by lighttpd 1.4.22 and earlier. In
    # lighttpd 1.4.23 the manpage was moved to lighttpd.8.
