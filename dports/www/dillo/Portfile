description	Simple but very fast web browser
long_description	\
		Dillo is a web browser project completely written in C. \
		Dillo is small: source is less than 365 KB, and the binary \
		is around 265 KB! \
		Dillo aims to be a multi-platform browser alternative \
		that's small, stable, developer-friendly, usable, fast, \
		and extensible. \
		Dillo is mainly based on GTK+ (GNOME is NOT required!) \
		Dillo is a free-SW project in the terms of the GNU general \
		public license. \
		Current code uses gzilla-0.2.2's html-parser, and almost \
		everything else was rewritten from scratch!. \
		Dillo is very fast!

#user_notes	Remember to set the DISPLAY environment variable \
#		to localhost:0.0 if you start dillo from a non-X11 \
#		terminal application.
